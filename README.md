# hangman_v1.py
Quick edit of python script to make it suitable for python 3.6
Code initially found online did not work, was able to change the code where needed to be changed to allow it to work for python version 3.x
Have also included some adjustment to personalise.
Feel free to personalise and expand...!!!
